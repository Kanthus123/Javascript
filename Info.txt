Herança em JavaScript

Every Javascript object has a prototype property, which makes enheritance possible in JavaScript;

The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit;

The Constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the Constructor itself, its the prototype of ALL instances that are created through it;

When a certain method (or property) is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found, the search moves on the objects prototype. This continues until the method is found: prototype chain;
